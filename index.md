## Notice on Allegations towards YandereDev
The creator of this service does not support the actions of Alex Mahan, aka YandereDev. Pedophilia and grooming is wrong and atrociously lewd. Yanchive is only available for the express purpose of archiving the game's development and documenting the disgusting things it's developer has done. In no way should it show support for Mahan and it never will.
